A quick review of what all these folders are for :

>> bin is for all your compiled code endpoint
>> cmd is where your main logic lives, get, post amd all methods and server configs
>> migrate is for db migrations
>> web is for your frontend code (React, Angular, Vanilla, etc)
>> internal is for all those go packages (files/func) which are not for the outer world (non-exportables) ... like rate limiters and so on
>> scripts is for containing scripts for starting server
>> docs is for swagger docs

***************************************************************************************

Now for hot reloading we can use Air-verse (what Nodemon does in a Node project)
>> install air-verse in your machine
>> run `air init` and change the default settings (we have changed following fileds : tmp_dir, bin, cmd, exclude_dir)
>> run command `air`

For advanced http features like middleware and grouping (not yet provided by net/http) we use the `Chi` library

For dotenv we can use the godotenv library to read from .env file
